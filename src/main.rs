        /* 
        In rust, there are 2 categories of datatypes:
        1. Scalar types
        2. Compound types

        Scalar is a single value. There are a few scalar data types:
        1. Integers
        2. Floating points
        3. Boolean
        4. Characters
        
        Integers

        There are 2 types of integers, signed & unsigned integers.
        signed integers can be negative or positive whereas unsigned
        are only positive.

        Another thing about integers, is that they come in different sizes. 
        they can be 8, 16, 32, 64 & 128 bits. There's also something called 
        `arch`

        if an integer is signed, you can calculate it's range using the formula
        -[2^(n-1)] to [2^(n-1) - 1]. signed integers use 2s complement.
